# Reason for using ejs
I have used ejs template engine because I feel that it is easy to use in comparison of another engines.
Mainly it is so similar to html so I found it easy.
It has very simple template tags <% %>.
One thing I notice while creating this project is ejs has a good error handling mechanism, it points out the exact line where the error has occurred.
